# Gemini Version — Claude Code Infrastructure Showcase

This repo is a Gemini-compatible adaptation of the Claude Code infra showcase.

Steps to get started:

1. Copy `.gemini/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, and `docs/` into your project.
2. Optionally install the VS Code extension in `vscode-extension/` to get skill suggestions.
3. Use the `skills/` SKILL.md files as prompts for Gemini.

Notes:

- This template intentionally keeps model calls abstract — integrate with your preferred Gemini client.
- The VS Code extension copies skill content to clipboard so you can paste into the Gemini UI or Google AI extension.
